In these cases source maps\r\ndon't get loaded by karma and you lose the advantages of having them.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nThis plug-in supports both inline and external source maps.\r\n\r\nInline source maps are located by searching \"sourceMappingURL=\" inside the javascript\r\nfile, both plain text and base64-encoded maps are supported.\r\n\r\nExternal source maps are located by appending \".map\" to the javascript file name.\r\nSo if for example you have Hello.js, the preprocessor will try to load source map from\r\nHello.js.map.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nJust write `karma-sourcemap-loader` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"karma-sourcemap-loader\": \"~0.2\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr just issue the following command:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install karma-sourcemap-loader --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nThe code below shows a sample configuration of the preprocessor.\r\n```js\r\n// karma.conf.js\r\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\r\n  config.set({\r\n    preprocessors: {\r\n      '**/*.js': ['sourcemap']\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to @goldibex for adding inline source mpas support.",
