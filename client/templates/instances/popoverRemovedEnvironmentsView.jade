p.weight-strong Environments Updated
//- if compose file still exists
p.small.text-gray To match&#32;
  //- link to latest compose file
  a.link(
    href = "#"
    target = "_blank"
  ) your latest Compose file
  | , we removed environments for these repositories:
//- if compose file doesn't exist
//- p.small.text-gray It looks like you deleted&#32;
  //- link to last existing compose file
  a.link(
    href = "#"
    target = "_blank"
  ) your Compose file
  | , so we removed environments for these repositories:
ul.ul.small.text-gray
  li.li(
    ng-repeat = "repo in affectedRepos"
  ) {{repo}}
button.btn.btn-sm.btn-block.gray.margin-top-xs ðŸ‘Œ Got it!
